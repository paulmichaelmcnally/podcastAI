However, we are considering various options to speedily deal with the situation,\" it said.Harmony said it viewed the incident - which occurred on May 18 - as a criminal matter and has handed it over to the South African police for further investigation.\"Harmony is working with the DMRE to provide direction on the next steps,\" said spokesperson Sihle Maake.Methane is a highly explosive greenhouse gas often found in underground mines and poses serious safety and health threats to mine workers.Reporting by Bhargav Acharya and Felix Njini; Editing by Emelia Sithole-MatariseOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with galleryAfricacategoryZambia seals $6.3 billion restructuring in breakthrough for developing nations7:57 AM UTCarticle with galleryMarketscategoryStocks under pressure as investors play terminal rates guessing game8:48 AM UTCBusinesscategoryOil resumes slide on demand worries after latest rate hikes8:16 AM UTCarticle with galleryWorldcategoryAmnesty accuses Spain and Morocco of cover-up over Melilla enclave migrant deaths6:07 AM UTCMore from ReutersWorldarticle with galleryIndia ordered inspection of Byju's last week - CNBC-TV18Indiacategory · June 23, 2023 · 8:49 AM UTCIndia's corporate affairs ministry ordered an inspection of edtech startup Byju's last week, CNBC-TV18 reported on Friday, citing sources.article with galleryWorldcategoryAmbitious plans for US-India technology sharing face hurdles4:17 AM UTCAsia PacificcategoryAnalysis: Asia heatwaves put renewable power fleet to the test7:38 AM UTCWorldcategoryRussia says West is trying to drive a wedge between it and Kazakhstan, TASS reports5:27 AM UTCUnited StatescategoryUS climate change lawsuit seeks $50 billion, citing 2021 heat wave1:08 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

You will always always be missed by all of us,\" read the words from the pupils at the school in White City. \\xa0The mutilated bodies of Zulu, 5, and Rabanye, 6, were found 1.4km apart in Rockville and White City, respectively, by residents after a nearly 24-hour search on Thursday last week.Pupils from the school and others  in the area sang hymns as they paid their respects at the memorial service.  \\xa0Speakers included Gauteng education MEC Matome Chiloane and  teachers. \\xa0Zulu\\'s teacher, Thoko Manyathi, described him as an angel from God. \"I don\\'t want to cry. We are here to celebrate to celebrate the life of Nqobozitha,\" she said. \\xa0She added that Nqobizitha liked playing and talking. \"Whenever you reprimand him, you will see him staring at me with an innocent look.

23 20238 25 AM UTCUpdated agoJOHANNESBURG June 23 Reuters South Africa is investigating the deaths of at least 31 people in a mine last month in the Free State province that has been closed for around 30 years the energy department said late on Thursday They are believed to be from neighbouring Lesotho which reported the incident to South African authorities and died in a ventilation shaft in Virginia mine in Welkom city the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy DMRE said It was not clear what caused their deaths but the DMRE said an investigation into the incident with the help of Harmony Gold HARJ J the previous owner of the mine which ceased operations in the 1990s determined that methane levels were very high in the ventilation shaft As such it is currently too risky to dispatch a search team to the shaft However we are considering various options to speedily deal with the situation it said Harmony said it viewed the incident which occurred on May 18 as a criminal matter and has handed it over to the South African police for further investigation Harmony is working with the DMRE to provide direction on the next steps said spokesperson Sihle Maake Methane is a

REUTERS/Philimon Bulawayo/File PhotoJOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand weakened against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Friday, as concerns about global economic growth weighed on risk sentiment.At 0727 GMT, the rand traded at 18.6300 against the dollar , 0.54% weaker than its previous close.Hawkish comments from global central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, stoked fears that their aggressive monetary tightening could push economies into a deeper downturn.The safe-haven dollar was buoyed by the comments and was last trading up 0.62% at 103.2 against a basket of six currencies.\"This morning, the rand has opened weaker at 18.60, aligning with the strength of the dollar, and there is a possibility of further losses towards the 18.75 level in the near future,\" said Andre Cilliers, a currency strategist at TreasuryONE.The risk-sensitive rand, like most emerging market currencies, often takes cues from global drivers such as U.S. monetary policy and the dollar in the absence of local economic data points.In the stock market, both the Top-40 (.JTOPI) index and the broader all-share (.JALSH) were down nearly 0.3% in early trade.South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was weaker in early deals, with the yield up 6 basis points to 10.755%.Reporting by Bhargav Acharya; Editing by Sonia CheemaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read NextU.S. MarketscategoryMorning Bid: Business brakes in June swoon, dollar jumps10:03 AM UTC .

EPA-EFE/SERGEI CHIRIKOV / POOL \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBy \\nPeter Fabricius \\n\\n\\n\\n Follow\\n Following\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n27 Apr 2023\\t\\n\\n Follow\\n Following\\n  \\n\\n 9 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa’s national security adviser Sydney Mufamadi is in Washington at the head of a delegation lobbying the Biden administration and congressional leaders. This comes amid concerns that South Africa’s controversial stance on Russia’s war against Ukraine is jeopardising SA’s economic and political relations with America. \\n\\n\\nSydney Mufamadi’s team is likely to focus its efforts on trying to ensure that South Africa is not expelled from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), a US law that gives duty- and quota-free access to the US market for selected African countries, including South Africa. The law is due to be extended or terminated in 2025, and there are growing concerns SA could be ejected then – or even before.\\xa0\\nMufamadi, with Ramaphosa’s legal adviser Nokukhanya Jele, and deputy minister of international relations and cooperation Alvin Botes, are meeting their administration “counterparts” as well as congressional leaders, probably including the Congressional Black Caucus, Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya confirmed to Daily Maverick.\\nHis confirmation that Mufamadi’s delegation would meet “counterparts” suggested they would meet President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, among others, but Magwenya did not specifically confirm that.\\nMagwenya said the delegation would discuss a wide range of issues in the relationship, including the upcoming negotiations on South Africa’s continued participation in Agoa – which gives SA privileged access to the lucrative market – and also the 2023 Agoa summit which is due to be hosted by South Africa during the second half of the year.\\nMagwenya said many other aspects of relations between SA and the US would also be discussed, many of them follow-ups to the discussions Ramaphosa had with President Biden in the White House last September. These would include US offers to support the fight against insurgents in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo, differences over US sanctions against Zimbabwe, increased US tariffs on SA steel imports and the US offer to support the SA National School of Government, which trains public servants.\\nMagwenya said the delegation was just part of the ongoing relationship with the US and suggested there was no particular concern in Pretoria which had motivated sending a special delegation to Washington.\\nHowever, US sources have said there is a growing concern in the US, particularly in Congress, about SA’s failure to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and a perception that SA is drifting further into the Russia-China camp at a time when Washington’s relations with those two countries are becoming more tense and competitive.\\nThese sources had said that these concerns were crystallising around SA’s participation in Agoa, which facilitated an extra $3-billion of SA exports to the US last year, much of it in manufacturing and other value-added goods which help create jobs in SA.\\nBRICS-Putin tangle\\nThe Agoa summit in SA was originally scheduled for September, but US sources said recently that concerns had been growing about it being held so soon after the BRICS summit which SA will host towards the end of August.\\nThe sources were saying if the Agoa summit was held just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin had visited South Africa, many US congressional leaders would not attend the Agoa summit. That could jeopardise SA’s continued participation in Agoa, as it is Congress that decides which African countries qualify for Agoa’s benefits.\\nIt would be particularly offensive to these congressional leaders to visit SA if Pretoria had just allowed Putin to visit the country in defiance of a request from the International Criminal Court (ICC) to SA to arrest and surrender the Russian leader, the sources said. The ICC has indicted him and issued a warrant for his arrest for the alleged war crime of abducting Ukrainian children and deporting them to Russia.\\nSources have told Daily Maverick that the Agoa summit has been postponed to November to try to avoid the proximity with the BRICS summit, but US concerns about Putin visiting SA remain.\\nRecently, Republican members of the US House of Representatives – which is now controlled by the Republicans – drafted a resolution condemning SA’s ever-closer ties with Russia and China, and called on the US administration to review US relations with South Africa, and in particular, the benefits which SA derives from Agoa.\\nMagwenya also played down these concerns. He said no one should be basing any decisions yet on Putin’s attendance at the BRICS summit, as attendance at the summit had not been finalised.\\nThough all BRICS leaders had been invited to the summit, he noted that Ramaphosa had also announced that South Africa was still considering how it would deal with the fact that the ICC had issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest and was “looking at all permutations” to address the issue.\\nMagwenya also downplayed the resolution on SA drafted by the House of Representatives Republicans, saying it had not even been tabled yet and was merely a proposal that had been circulated. “And as far as we know, it’s not going very far.”\\nHe said Biden had shown an appreciation for SA’s position on Russia and the historical reasons for it when he met Ramaphosa in the White House last year.\\xa0\\n“He also appreciated that President Ramaphosa has an open line to President Putin, which he has consistently used to tell him the conflict needs to be resolved peacefully and soon.”\\nThe US also appreciated that Ramaphosa had an open line to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\\n“So while there may be discomfort by the US that we have chosen to be non-aligned in this conflict, there is an appreciation that we can get messages to both Putin and Zelensky.”\\nMagwenya said while some members of the US establishment might feel differently from the Biden administration, “we didn’t walk away from Washington last year with the sense that the US would adopt any punitive measures that would undermine our relationship. And since then we have seen no signs pointing in that direction.” DM\\n\\nShare to Facebook\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nShare to Twitter\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare to Email App\\n\\nEmail App\\n\\n\\n\\nShare to WhatsApp\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\n\\n\\nHide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAGOABiden administrationBRICSCyril RamaphosaPETER FABRICIUSPutinRussiaSydney MufamadiUkraineUS Congress \\n\\n\\n\\nComments - share your knowledge and experience\\nPlease note you must be a\\nMaverick Insider\\nto comment.\\nSign up here\\nor sign in if you are already an Insider. \\n\\nEverybody has an opinion but not everyone has the knowledge and the experience\\nto contribute meaningfully to a discussion.\\nThat’s what we want from our members.

Any government, with an iota of common sense, decency and acting in the best interests of the country and NOT for its own party’s obnoxious and nefarious interests, would have carefully thought and evaluated its policy before moronically and blindly aligning with nothing but an evil, deranged and mass-murdering thug that is Putin.

Once again South Africa appears to want their cake and eat it without giving anything back in return. We should be kicked out of Agoa – until the Guptas are repatriated to face criminal charges and we resign from the rotten, corrupt, morally anorexic BRICS cartel. The USA has some leverage with which it can negotiate – which is more than what the taxpayers in this country have….we’re just sitting ducks watching our stolen revenue going into the pockets of the politically corrupt!\\nLog in to Reply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbushboyvos says: \\n\\n28 April 2023 at 06:52 \\nSup with the devil, Cyril – don’t hide your spare spoons in the couch\\nLog in to Reply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarsten Rasch says: \\n\\n28 April 2023 at 07:10 \\nI guess that’s what happens when you live in bubble – you are unable to read the room…\\nLog in to Reply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDerek Jones says: \\n\\n28 April 2023 at 07:12 \\n“We have to be nice to them because it’s your fault.

            "Dubbed a “peace mission” by the group, the trip puzzled many observers.\n",
            "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, many African countries have remained publicly neutral and abstained from voting against Russia at United Nations meetings.\n",
            "In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. South Africa’s apparent reluctance to enforce that writ during Putin’s expected visit to Cape Town this August is being interpreted as Pretoria tilting to Moscow’s side.\n",
            "A recent allegation by the United States ambassador to South Africa that Pretoria was supplying arms to Moscow has also put South Africa in a diplomatic dilemma.\n",
            "All that was before this month’s trip. Reportedly brokered by Algerian-born French businessman Jean-Yves Ollivier, it had no backing from the African Union.\n",
            "And it was almost thwarted by a number of unexpected scenarios.\n",
            "First, three members of the original party – Egypt’s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Republic of the Congo’s President Denis Sassou Nguesso and Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni – cancelled days ahead of the trip. Ollivier is a known associate of Nguesso.\n",
            "And then there was a logistical nightmare involving South African security officials. A plane carrying journalists, security personnel and 15 containers with weapons from Johannesburg was detained at the Warsaw airport by Polish authorities.\n",
            "After three days, the plane returned to Johannesburg as Warsaw insisted that the South Africans did not have the correct paperwork for the mission.\n",
            "Despite these setbacks, Ramaphosa, Senegal’s leader Macky Sall, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema and Comoros President Azali Assoumani, who also holds the rotating chair of the AU, eventually made it. So did representatives of the Ugandan and Egyptian leaders.\n",
            "The contingent met Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, before heading to Moscow to see Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\n",
            "The delegation put forward a 10-point plan that included sending prisoners of war and children back to their countries of origin and unimpeded grain exports through the Black Sea. But the effort is yet to yield any results.\n",
            "During a joint press conference with the African delegation, Zelenskyy reiterated that there would be no peace agreement while Russia continues to occupy parts of Ukraine, telling reporters that to allow any such dialogue is “to freeze the war, to freeze everything: pain and suffering”.\n",
            "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in televised remarks that Moscow shared the “main approaches” of the African plan, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying peace was “difficult to realise”.\n",
            "As the African delegation was in Kyiv, Russian missiles shelled Ukraine, forcing the visiting group to seek cover in a bomb shelter.\n",

            "‘An attempt to … punch above its weight’\n",
            "The shortcomings of the trip have led to plenty of reactions back in Africa, especially in South Africa.\n",
            "The mission “was an attempt to reaffirm that the country can and does punch above its weight in global terms … but fell flat largely because South Africa has been naive” in foreign policy, Ayesha Kajee, a research fellow at Johannesburg-based think thank Africa Asia Dialogues, told Al Jazeera.\n",
            "Kajee told Al Jazeera that “the weakness of the mission is that Africa has not been able to resolve its own conflicts”.\n",
            "The left-leaning opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party mocked Ramaphosa and the mission while condemning the Polish authorities.\n",
            "“The South African head of state had to travel to Kyiv in a compromised state, in a war zone, without his security detail. This is an unacceptable and deliberate form of humiliation,” the statement said.\n",
            "“While Cyril Ramaphosa is an incompetent and corrupt buffoon of imperialism who is incapable of taking a firm stance on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the South African state and our sovereignty were undermined through him.”\n",
            "For some analysts, while the mission may not have achieved any immediate success, it presented an opportunity for Africa to discuss first hand the effects of the war – especially on food security – on millions across the continent, from Antananarivo to Addis Ababa and Cape Town to Cairo.\n",
            "According to the African Development Bank, the war has led to a shortage of about 30 million tonnes of grain in Africa.\n",
            "“The fact that Africa was able to express itself around the conflict was a good thing … some say Africa had no business going there when we have conflicts here,” Christopher Afoke Isike, a professor of African politics and international relations at the University of Pretoria, told Al Jazeera.\n",
            "“[But] the conflict is impacting us directly with the shortage of grain exports and fertilisers …the war is a threat to Africa; more so than the conflict in Sudan. It was a matter of continental interest,” he added.\n",

            "‘Ramaphosa’s ego trip’\n",
            "Meanwhile, Ramaphosa has hailed the initiative as “historic”, saying the delegation took “a non-aligned stance” on the issue, which “lent credibility to the mission and engendered trust from both sides”.\n",
            "“Another point of the peace proposal being put forward by African leaders is the opening up of the movement of grains across the Black Sea for grains from Russia or Ukraine to reach world markets,” added Ramaphosa in his newsletter this week.\n",
            "But there is still a perception that Ramaphosa, who led the delegation, was seeking to score points abroad as he faces a barrage of problems at home.\n",
            "National power utility Eskom is still struggling to resolve repeated blackouts for as many as 12 or more hours daily nationwide, despite Ramaphosa’s appointment of an electricity minister. And soaring living costs have made the president increasingly unpopular.\n",
            "The main opposition Democratic Alliance’s John Steenhuisen told Al Jazeera that millions of rands in taxpayer funds had been wasted on the trip, which he said was “designed to spin the utterly incompetent Ramaphosa out of trouble over his ongoing support for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin”.\n",
            "“He even flew an entire contingent of journalists to Europe in the obvious hope that they would help save his collapsed political image, said Steenhuisen. “Ramaphosa’s ego trip to Europe has spectacularly backfired.”\n",
            "“We were collateral damage,” Lindsay Dentlinger, a broadcast journalist on the trip, said in an interview with a local radio station. “There was a bureaucratic bungle from the SA side.”\n",

The regulator has permanently barred him from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.

            "In a leafy suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, green leaves adorn the walls of a school where students learn how to grow cannabis — but smoking pot is banned. The teaching aims to dispel stigma around marijuana, says Linda Siboto, the co-founder of the institution, which styles itself as Africa’s first cannabis academy. “It’s important for us to professionalise this industry and basically showcase that we’re not stoners with red eyes all the time talking about how great the weed is,” he says. The academy is hoping to ride a global re-think of cannabis regulations. From Spain to California, a growing number of governments are allowing people to light up. In Africa, tiny Lesotho green-lighted cultivation of medicinal cannabis in 2017, paving the way for others like Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa, which aspires to become a marijuana powerhouse. President Cyril Ramaphosa last year said cannabis has “huge potential” to draw investments and “create more than 130,000 new jobs”, a big pull in a country with an ailing economy and massive unemployment. Named after a slang word for weed, the Cheeba Cannabis Academy is preparing students to partake in the expected bonanza. “The industry, in order to develop, is going to need training and education,” says Siboto, 42. School days start with a yoga session, under a holistic approach, with subject matters including business, nutrition and futurism. On a Thursday morning, about a dozen students sit at wooden desks before donning white coats to enter a laboratory at the back of the classroom. There Darian Jacobsen, a passionate cultivation teacher, showcases different pruning techniques before moving onto some common-sense tips that learners note down on their pads. “She’s not dead, sick or dying, she’s just a little thirsty,” Jacobsen, 28, says of a droopy-looking plant he takes out of an indoor grow tent. The academy started offering online classes in 2020 before moving to its current premises last year. The flagship course lasts 12 weeks and costs around $1,600. The school has so far trained about 600 people and is hoping to get a leg-up from the government, which has announced grand but so far sketchy plans for cannabis.\n",

(Photo: Gallo Images / Sowetan / Thuli Dlamini) \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nBy \\nWayne Sussman \\n\\n\\n\\n Follow\\n Following\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n27 Apr 2023\\t\\n\\n Follow\\n Following\\n  \\n\\n 1 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ANC had a tough night as it lost a seat in the Free State to the EFF and the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal, while the DA ran the ruling party close in a Hermanus township in the Western Cape. \\n\\n\\nWard 17 (Fateng Tse Ntsho Paul Roux) in Dihlabeng, Thabo Mofutsanyane: EFF 57% (44% PR) ANC 36% (45% PR) PFA 3% (5% PR) IFP 2% (<1% PR) PA 2% (DNC) AULA <1% (<1% PR)\\xa0\\nThe setting: This is the first Free State by-election since the local government elections in November 2021. It is taking place in the township of Fateng Tse Ntsho which is next to the tiny town of Paul Roux. Paul Roux is on the N5 national road and sits on the road between Senekal and Bethlehem. The ward also includes two sparsely populated rural voting stations east of Paul Roux on the road to Bethlehem.\\xa0 However, 90% of the voters reside in Fateng Tse Ntsho. Dihlabeng’s seat of power is in Bethlehem and the towns of Clarens, Rosendal and Fouriesburg. It forms part of the Eastern Free State district of Thabo Mofutsanyane.\\xa0\\nThe 2021 local government elections: The ANC had limited losses in Dihlabeng, falling from 25 to 23 seats. The party performed adequately in Dihlabeng, while suffering major losses in nearby municipalities like Maluti a-Phofung (Phudatijhaba) and Setsotso (Ficksburg). It did however underperform in Fateng Tse Ntsho. It fell from 70% on the proportional representation (PR) ballot to 45%, while the EFF more than doubled its support from 21% to 44% on the PR ballot. The ANC beat the EFF by 18 votes on the PR ballot, while the ANC won the ward election by 22 votes. Both ballots were razor-thin. The EFF fell 1% short on both ballots. The EFF grew from three to four seats in the municipality. One of the reasons it grew was because of Fateng Tse Ntsho.\\xa0\\nThe EFF won the most vote-rich district in the ward, Rekgotsofetse Secondary School, by 150 votes. The ANC had to play catch-up and won the second-most vote-rich district, Sekoko Primary School, by 100 votes. What was crucial for the ANC was the voting district which had the lowest turnout, but where the party ran up the numbers, the rural Matoppo farm voting district. It got 48 votes more than the EFF here and then also won the rural Duikfontein school district by 20 votes.\\xa0\\nThe by-election: The veteran ANC ward councillor passed away. The ANC and EFF were joined on the ballot by two regional parties, the Progressive Front of Azania (PFA) and the All Unemployment Labour Alliance (AULA). The Patriotic Alliance (PA) and IFP were also on the ballot. The EFF fielded the same candidate it did in the 2021 local government elections – Malefetsane Mokoena. The party beat the ANC by just under 500 votes to pick up a famous victory in Dihlabeng. It increased its percentage share of the vote in all four voting districts, while the ANC was only able to increase its percentage share in the district with the fewest voters on the day. The EFF beat the ANC by 378 votes at Rekgofetse Secondary School. Turnout was also highest at this, the most populous district in the ward. The EFF also flipped the Sekoko Primary School district, the second-most populous district in the ward, by getting 125 more votes than the ANC.\\xa0\\nIn the 2021 elections the ANC benefited from a rural turnout differential, with percentage turnout in the two farming districts being higher than the turnout in the two districts in Fateng Tse Ntsho. This was not the case in this by-election. Turnout was higher in Fateng Tse Ntsho than the two less-populated farming districts. The EFF also won the Matoppo Farm district off the ANC, obtaining 51% of the vote, well up from the 25% it received there in 2021, while the ANC fell from 69% to 41%. The ANC held the Duikfontein School district but few votes were cast there.\\xa0\\nThe EFF will now be able to build the narrative that it has serious momentum in the Free State. This was the first by-election in the province since early November 2021 and an ANC seat is now in the EFF column.\\xa0\\nThe new council composition is: ANC 22 (23) DA 7 EFF 5 (4) AULA 2 FF+ 2 Independent 1 F4SD 1. Total: 40.\\xa0\\nPoll: 61% (53%)\\nWard 19 (Mseleni Mbazwana) in uMhlabuyalingana, uMkhanyakude: IFP 53% (37%) ANC 38% (41%) EFF 9% (16%)\\nThe setting: This rural ward abuts Lake Sibaya in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. It has five villages in the ward, with Mseleni, Mbazwana and Ntshongwe having the most voters. uMhlabuyalingana is the most northeasterly municipality in Kwazulu-Natal, in the corner of the province where it borders Eswatini and Mozambique. The council is located in Manguzi. It is part of the far-north district of uMkhanyakude. It is a very rural district, the largest town being Mtubatuba in the south, with Hluhluwe, Mkuze and Jozini also forming part of it.\\nThe 2021 local government elections: The ANC beat the IFP here by 100 votes. This was despite the IFP winning four of the seven voting districts in the ward, including the three with the most registered voters, and the ANC only winning two districts.\\xa0\\nRead more in Daily Maverick: ANC and Patriotic Alliance give DA the Barrydale blues with second Western Cape defeat\\nThe ANC won the ward by running up the numbers at Kwa-Mboma Primary School in Mseleni. The turnout was high here, with 62% of the registered voters showing up, and the ANC also won just under 80% of the vote to get 229 votes more than the IFP. The margin between the IFP and the ANC was much closer at the three most-populous voting districts. The ANC won a smaller voting district as well, again with a similar recipe: high turnout and a large margin of victory in the district. The EFF won a voting district in Sibhoweni, where it relegated the IFP to second place.\\xa0\\nThe uMhlabuyalingana council grew from 35 to 39 seats in 2021. Despite these additional four seats in the council, the ANC still lost five seats to fall from 23 to 18. The IFP grew from nine seats to 15. The EFF was a long way back in third place, with two seats, but was the only other party to win more than one seat. The IFP won the backing of the EFF, the DA and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) to tie with the ANC and the National Freedom Party (NFP) on 19 seats each. A regional party, the Abahlali Base Mkhanyakude Movement (ABMM), supported the IFP, and the latter won the mayorship.\\xa0\\nThe by-election: When the EFF ditched the IFP in favour of working with the ANC, it was clear that the IFP’s days of running Umhlabuyalingana were all but over. However, one of the ANC councillors delayed the inevitable by resigning from the council. Regardless of the outcome of this by-election, the ANC will still be able to take control of Umhlabuyalingana with the support of the EFF and the NFP. There were only three parties on the ballot – the ANC, IFP and EFF. The EFF was desperate for a solid showing in a KwaZulu-Natal by-election.\\xa0\\nThe IFP beat the ANC by close to 500 votes as it won another KwaZulu-Natal seat off the ruling party. The IFP picked up respective voting districts off the ANC and the EFF, but also lost one to the ANC. Kwa-Mboma Primary School in Mseleni was key to the ANC victory in 2021, where it got close to 80% of the vote and the IFP managed only 15%. In this by-election the IFP turned the tables on the ANC, winning 53% of the vote, with the latter’s percentage vote share plummeting to 45%. The IFP also improved at Vimbukhalo Primary School in Mseleni, winning 64% compared with 51% in 2021. The ANC all but matched its 2021 showing, but the EFF declined from 11% to 6%.\\xa0\\nIn Sibhoweni (Esibhoweni Primary School), the IFP went from 29% to 45%, while the EFF dropped from 49% to 38%. Turnout was highest in Sibhoweni, with 69% of the registered voters showing up. The IFP also surged in the other Sibhoweni voting district (Magcekeni school), moving from 41% to 77%, while the EFF fell from 37% to 9%.\\xa0\\nThe ANC will want to study the Tshongwe Primary School district in Ntshongwe as the party went from 37% to 54% to beat the IFP here. The IFP remained on 41%, while the EFF declined from 17% to 5%.\\nThe IFP narrowed the gap at the Old Tribal Court in Kwa-Mabaso, as it grew from 33% to 46%, with the ANC losing ground to finish on 53% compared with the previous 63%. The IFP also gained at the uMhlabuyalingana Traffic Department in Mbazwana, going from 47% to 57%. The ANC and EFF essentially replicated their 2021 showing here.\\xa0\\nThe new uMhlabuyalingana council composition is: ANC 17 (18) IFP 16 (15) EFF 2 ABMM 1 NFP 1 DA 1 ACDP 1. Total: 39. The ANC, EFF and NFP have 20/39 seats and should still be able to take over this municipality.\\xa0\\nPoll: 65% (55%)\\nWard 5 (Zwelihle) in Overstrand, Overberg: ANC 37% (56%) DA 30% (12%) EFF 16% (3%) LAND 15% (26%) PA 2% (DNC)\\nThe setting: Zwelihle is a township west of the Hermanus town centre, between Hermanus and Sandbaai. Hermanus is the seat of power of Overstrand. Overstrand includes Kleinmond, Pringle Bay and Gansbaai. The Overberg includes Grabouw, Swellendam and Bredasdorp.\\xa0\\nThe 2021 local government elections: The ANC beat local party LAND by a margin of greater than 2:1 in Ward 2. There are two other wards in Zwelihle. In Ward 6, LAND beat the ANC, while in Ward 12, the ANC beat LAND by a very narrow margin. Of the three Zwelihle wards, this is the least competitive. The DA beat the EFF to third place in this ward. The turnout was very low in this ward. This might explain why the ANC lost three of its seven seats on the council, with LAND remaining on two. The DA grew from 16 to 17 seats to cement its dominance in this 27-seat council.\\xa0\\nThe by-election: The ANC councillor was stabbed to death. The ANC and LAND were joined by the DA, the EFF and the PA on the ballot.\\xa0\\nThe ANC did not have it all its own way in Zwelihle. The DA ran the party close in both voting districts, with the ANC getting 50 more votes than the DA in each district to win by 100 votes.\\xa0\\nOnce more there was a turnout differential advantage in the favour of the Yomelelani part of the ward as 43% of registered voters participated there, while only 26% showed up at Qhayiya Secondary School.\\xa0\\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Key Tshwane win gives ANC a motivation boost while DA suffers low-turnout blow\\nThe ANC won both voting districts, with the DA getting silver. The EFF came third at Qhayiya, with LAND finishing third in Yomelalani. The EFF beat LAND for third place by four votes.\\nThis was a disappointing result for both the ANC and LAND. While at least the ANC walked away with the ward councillor position, LAND fell from second to fourth place. The DA will be delighted that it won 30% of the vote in a township.

The teaching aims to dispel stigma around marijuana, says Linda Siboto, the co-founder of the institution, which styles itself as Africa’s first cannabis academy. “It’s important for us to professionalise this industry and basically showcase that we’re not stoners with red eyes all the time talking about how great the weed is,” he says. The academy is hoping to ride a global re-think of cannabis regulations. From Spain to California, a growing number of governments are allowing people to light up. In Africa, tiny Lesotho green-lighted cultivation of medicinal cannabis in 2017, paving the way for others like Zimbabwe, Malawi and South Africa, which aspires to become a marijuana powerhouse. President Cyril Ramaphosa last year said cannabis has “huge potential” to draw investments and “create more than 130,000 new jobs”, a big pull in a country with an ailing economy and massive unemployment. Named after a slang word for weed, the Cheeba Cannabis Academy is preparing students to partake in the expected bonanza. “The industry, in order to develop, is going to need training and education,” says Siboto, 42. School days start with a yoga session, under a holistic approach, with subject matters including business, nutrition and futurism. On a Thursday morning, about a dozen students sit at wooden desks before donning white coats to enter a laboratory at the back of the classroom. There Darian Jacobsen, a passionate cultivation teacher, showcases different pruning techniques before moving onto some common-sense tips that learners note down on their pads. “She’s not dead, sick or dying, she’s just a little thirsty,” Jacobsen, 28, says of a droopy-looking plant he takes out of an indoor grow tent. The academy started offering online classes in 2020 before moving to its current premises last year. The flagship course lasts 12 weeks and costs around $1,600. The school has so far trained about 600 people and is hoping to get a leg-up from the government, which has announced grand but so far sketchy plans for cannabis.\\n\\nSubmit a Comment \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nPrimary Sidebar \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest News\\nPakistan leads South Asia in university rankings 2023Bayer pharmaceutical company announces closing business in PakistanPakistan’s Shahzada Dawood among five confirmed dead in Titanic submersible tragedyHow many Pakistanis were onboard the boat that sunk near Greece?Gold Rate in Pakistan Today – 23 June 2023\\nPakistan\\nPakistan leads South Asia in university rankings 2023Bayer pharmaceutical company announces closing business in PakistanPakistan’s Shahzada Dawood among five confirmed dead in Titanic submersible tragedyGold Rate in Pakistan Today – 23 June 2023Rupee gains 24 paisas against dollar in interbankMore Posts from this Category\\nBusiness\\nCooperation for establishment of industrial park in Islamabad ensured: ministerGold price stands at Rs 217,000 per tolaHashoo School of Hospitality Management (HSHM) offers job opportunities to students for abroad with key partnershipsCaltex and Be Energy inaugurate first Caltex flagship fuel stationExport of sport goods increases 12.75% to to $370mMore Posts from this Category\\nWorld\\nHow many Pakistanis were onboard the boat that sunk near Greece?Asian Group endorses Pakistan for UNSC non-permanent seatRescue underway after Spain migrant shipwreck leaves dozens deadMore Posts from this Category\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFooter Home\\nLead Stories\\nLatest News\\nEditor’s Picks\\n\\n\\n Culture\\nLife & Style\\nFeatured\\nVideos\\n\\n\\n Editorials\\nOP-EDS\\nCommentary\\nAdvertise\\n\\n\\n Cartoons\\nLetters\\nBlogs\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\n\\n Contact\\nCompany’s Financials\\nInvestor Information\\nTerms & Conditions\\n\\n\\n Facebook\\nTwitter\\nInstagram\\nYoutube\\n\\n\\n Copyright ©\\xa02023 Daily Times Website Developed By Daily Times Developers\\n\\n\\n\\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.
